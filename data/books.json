This new edition of the widely used analysis book continues to cover real analysis in greater detail and at a more advanced level than most books on the subject. Encompassing several subjects that underlie much of modern analysis, the book focuses on measure and integration theory, point set topology, and the basics of functional analysis. It illustrates the use of the general theories and introduces readers to other branches of analysis such as Fourier analysis, distribution theory, and probability theory. This edition is bolstered in content as well as in scope-extending its usefulness to students outside of pure analysis as well as those interested in dynamical systems. The numerous exercises, extensive bibliography, and review chapter on sets and metric spaces make Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications, Second Edition invaluable for students in graduate-level analysis courses. New features include: * Revised material on the n-dimensional Lebesgue integral. * An improved proof of Tychonoff's theorem. * Expanded material on Fourier analysis. * A newly written chapter devoted to distributions and differential equations. * Updated material on Hausdorff dimension and fractal dimension.","pageCount":408,"printType":"BOOK","averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":2,"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wI4fAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=038795385X&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wI4fAwAAQBAJ&dq=038795385X&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Real_Analysis.html?hl=&id=wI4fAwAAQBAJ","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wI4fAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wI4fAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"categories":["Mathematics"],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781118626399","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f68bad30a7d19d568ebb" }},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1118626397","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f68bad30a7d19d568eba" }}],"authors":["Gerald B.

In time, the notions of curve and surface were generalized along with associated notions such as length, volume, and curvature. At the same time the topic has become closely allied with developments in topology. The basic object is a smooth manifold, to which some extra structure has been attached, such as a Riemannian metric, a symplectic form, a distinguished group of symmetries, or a connection on the tangent bundle. This book is a graduate-level introduction to the tools and structures of modern differential geometry. Included are the topics usually found in a course on differentiable manifolds, such as vector bundles, tensors, differential forms, de Rham cohomology, the Frobenius theorem and basic Lie group theory. The book also contains material on the general theory of connections on vector bundles and an in-depth chapter on semi-Riemannian geometry that covers basic material about Riemannian manifolds and Lorentz manifolds. An unusual feature of the book is the inclusion of an early chapter on the differential geometry of hypersurfaces in Euclidean space. There is also a section that derives the exterior calculus version of Maxwell's equations. The first chapters of the book are suitable for a one-semester course on manifolds. There is more than enough material for a year-long course on manifolds and geometry.","pageCount":671,"printType":"BOOK","language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QqHdHy9WsEoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=038795385X&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QqHdHy9WsEoC&dq=038795385X&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Manifolds_and_Differential_Geometry.html?hl=&id=QqHdHy9WsEoC","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QqHdHy9WsEoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QqHdHy9WsEoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"categories":["Mathematics"],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780821848159","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f68bad30a7d19d568ec8" }},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0821848151","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f68bad30a7d19d568ec7" }}],"authors":["Jeffrey Marc Lee"]},"__v":0}

Designed for the student with little engineering or mathematical background, the book outlines the basic principles of aerodynamics and physics, using only a minimal amount of high school?level algebra and trigonometry necessary to illustrate key concepts. This expanded seventeen chapter Second Edition reflects the cutting edge of aeronautic theory and practice, and has been revised, reorganized, and updated with 30% new information?including a new chapter on helicopter flight. Central to the book?s structure is a clear description of aeronautic basics?what lifts and drives an aircraft, and what forces work for and against it?all detailed in the context of the design and analysis of today?s aircraft systems: Atmosphere and airspeed measurement Airfoils and aerodynamic forces Lift and drag Jet aircraft basic and applied performance Prop aircraft basic and applied performance Slow and high-speed flight Takeoff, landing, and maneuvering performance The book?s practical, self-study format includes problems at the end of each chapter, with answers at the back of the book, as well as chapter-end summaries of symbols and equations. An ideal text for the USN Aviation Safety Officer and the USAAA?s Aviation Safety Officer courses, as well as for professional pilots, student pilots, and flying safety personnel, Flight Theory and Aerodynamics is a complete and accessible guide to the subject, updated for the new millennium.","pageCount":314,"printType":"BOOK","averageRating":5,"ratingsCount":1,"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8DkA9ZcrcisC&printsec=frontcover&dq=9780538497817&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8DkA9ZcrcisC&dq=9780538497817&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Flight_Theory_and_Aerodynamics.html?hl=&id=8DkA9ZcrcisC","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8DkA9ZcrcisC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8DkA9ZcrcisC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"categories":["Technology & Engineering"],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0471370061","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f2ff53eb6f15975ca043" }},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780471370062","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f2ff53eb6f15975ca042" }}],"authors":["Charles E.

Solving problems being an essential part of the learning process, my goal is to provide those learning and teaching linear algebra with a large number of worked out exercises. Lang's textbook covers all the topics in linear algebra that are usually taught at the undergraduate level: vector spaces, matrices and linear maps including eigenvectors and eigenvalues, determinants, diagonalization of symmetric and hermitian maps, unitary maps and matrices, triangulation, Jordan canonical form, and convex sets. Therefore this solutions manual can be helpful to anyone learning or teaching linear algebra at the college level. As the understanding of the first chapters is essential to the comprehension of the later, more involved chapters, I encourage the reader to work through all of the problems of Chapters I, II, III and IV. Often earlier exercises are useful in solving later problems. (For example, Exercise 35, §3 of Chapter II shows that a strictly upper triangular matrix is nilpotent and this result is then used in Exercise 7, §1 of Chapter X. } To make the solutions concise, I have included only the necessary arguments; the reader may have to fill in the details to get complete proofs. Finally, I thank Serge Lang for giving me the opportunity to work on this solutions manual, and I also thank my brother Karim and Steve Miller for their helpful comments and their support.","pageCount":200,"printType":"BOOK","language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7RR3GPKp554C&printsec=frontcover&dq=9780387962016&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7RR3GPKp554C&dq=9780387962016&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Solutions_Manual_for_Lang_s_Linear_Algeb.html?hl=&id=7RR3GPKp554C","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7RR3GPKp554C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7RR3GPKp554C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"categories":["Mathematics"],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0387947604","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f31c53eb6f15975ca05b" }},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780387947600","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f31c53eb6f15975ca05a" }}],"authors":["Rami Shakarchi"]},"__v":0}

It covers all the topics traditionally taught in the first-year calculus sequence in a brief and elementary fashion. As sociological and educational conditions have evolved in various ways over the past four decades, it has been found worthwhile to make the original edition available again. The audience consists of those taking the first calculus course, in high school or college. The approach is the one which was successful decades ago, involving clarity, and adjusted to a time when the students¿ background was not as substantial as it might be. We are now back to those times, so it¿s time to start over again. There are no epsilon-deltas, but this does not imply that the book is not rigorous. Lang learned this attitude from Emil Artin, around 1950.","pageCount":260,"printType":"BOOK","language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XUjod_RjjX8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=9780387962016&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XUjod_RjjX8C&dq=9780387962016&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Short_Calculus.html?hl=&id=XUjod_RjjX8C","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XUjod_RjjX8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XUjod_RjjX8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"categories":["Mathematics"],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0387953272","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f31c53eb6f15975ca061" }},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780387953274","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f31c53eb6f15975ca060" }}],"authors":["Serge Lang"]},"__v":0}

Solving problems being an essential part of the learning process, my goal is to provide those learning and teaching linear algebra with a large number of worked out exercises. Lang's textbook covers all the topics in linear algebra that are usually taught at the undergraduate level: vector spaces, matrices and linear maps including eigenvectors and eigenvalues, determinants, diagonalization of symmetric and hermitian maps, unitary maps and matrices, triangulation, Jordan canonical form, and convex sets. Therefore this solutions manual can be helpful to anyone learning or teaching linear algebra at the college level. As the understanding of the first chapters is essential to the comprehension of the later, more involved chapters, I encourage the reader to work through all of the problems of Chapters I, II, III and IV. Often earlier exercises are useful in solving later problems. (For example, Exercise 35, §3 of Chapter II shows that a strictly upper triangular matrix is nilpotent and this result is then used in Exercise 7, §1 of Chapter X. } To make the solutions concise, I have included only the necessary arguments; the reader may have to fill in the details to get complete proofs. Finally, I thank Serge Lang for giving me the opportunity to work on this solutions manual, and I also thank my brother Karim and Steve Miller for their helpful comments and their support.","pageCount":200,"printType":"BOOK","language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7RR3GPKp554C&printsec=frontcover&dq=9780387962016&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7RR3GPKp554C&dq=9780387962016&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Solutions_Manual_for_Lang_s_Linear_Algeb.html?hl=&id=7RR3GPKp554C","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7RR3GPKp554C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7RR3GPKp554C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"categories":["Mathematics"],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0387947604","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f419a9c669ee9ab15937" }},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780387947600","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f419a9c669ee9ab15936" }}],"authors":["Rami Shakarchi"]},"__v":0}

The audience consists of those taking the first calculus course, in high school or college. The approach is the one which was successful decades ago, involving clarity, and adjusted to a time when the students¿ background was not as substantial as it might be. We are now back to those times, so it¿s time to start over again. There are no epsilon-deltas, but this does not imply that the book is not rigorous.

The second edition includes many new topics and features: (1 } New sections in graph theory on distance, Eulerian trails, and hamiltonian paths. (2 } New material on partitions, multinomial coefficients, and the pigeonhole principle. (3 } Expanded coverage of Pólya Theory to include de Bruijn s method for counting arrangements when a second symmetry group acts on the set of allowed colors. (4 } Topics in combinatorial geometry, including Erdos and Szekeres development of Ramsey Theory in a problem about convex polygons determined by sets of points. (5 } Expanded coverage of stable marriage problems, and new sections on marriage problems for infinite sets, both countable and uncountable. (6 } Numerous new exercises throughout the book. About the First Edition: . . . this is what a textbook should be! The book is comprehensive without being overwhelming, the proofs are elegant, clear and short, and the examples are well picked.

Solving problems being an essential part of the learning process, my goal is to provide those learning and teaching linear algebra with a large number of worked out exercises. Lang's textbook covers all the topics in linear algebra that are usually taught at the undergraduate level: vector spaces, matrices and linear maps including eigenvectors and eigenvalues, determinants, diagonalization of symmetric and hermitian maps, unitary maps and matrices, triangulation, Jordan canonical form, and convex sets. Therefore this solutions manual can be helpful to anyone learning or teaching linear algebra at the college level. As the understanding of the first chapters is essential to the comprehension of the later, more involved chapters, I encourage the reader to work through all of the problems of Chapters I, II, III and IV. Often earlier exercises are useful in solving later problems. (For example, Exercise 35, §3 of Chapter II shows that a strictly upper triangular matrix is nilpotent and this result is then used in Exercise 7, §1 of Chapter X. } To make the solutions concise, I have included only the necessary arguments; the reader may have to fill in the details to get complete proofs. Finally, I thank Serge Lang for giving me the opportunity to work on this solutions manual, and I also thank my brother Karim and Steve Miller for their helpful comments and their support.","pageCount":200,"printType":"BOOK","language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7RR3GPKp554C&printsec=frontcover&dq=9780387962016&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7RR3GPKp554C&dq=9780387962016&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Solutions_Manual_for_Lang_s_Linear_Algeb.html?hl=&id=7RR3GPKp554C","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7RR3GPKp554C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7RR3GPKp554C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"categories":["Mathematics"],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0387947604","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f428a9c669ee9ab15957" }},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780387947600","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f428a9c669ee9ab15956" }}],"authors":["Rami Shakarchi"]},"__v":0}

This book features: Examples demonstrating the use of statistical thinking and methodology for practicing engineers A large number of chapter exercises that provide the opportunity for readers to solve engineering-related problems, often using real data sets Clear illustrations of the relationship between hypothesis tests and confidence intervals Extensive use of Minitab and JMP to illustrate statistical analyses The book is written in an engaging style that interconnects and builds on discussions, examples, and methods as readers progress from chapter to chapter. The assumptions on which the methodology is based are stated and tested in applications. Each chapter concludes with a summary highlighting the key points that are needed in order to advance in the text, as well as a list of references for further reading. Certain chapters that contain more than a few methods also provide end-of-chapter guidelines on the proper selection and use of those methods. Bridging the gap between statistics education and real-world applications, Modern Engineering Statistics is ideal for either a one- or two-semester course in engineering statistics.","pageCount":736,"printType":"BOOK","language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aZn7XNphKcgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=0387947604&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aZn7XNphKcgC&dq=0387947604&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Modern_Engineering_Statistics.html?hl=&id=aZn7XNphKcgC","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aZn7XNphKcgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aZn7XNphKcgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"categories":["Mathematics"],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0470128437","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f677ad30a7d19d568ea1" }},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780470128435","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f677ad30a7d19d568ea0" }}],"authors":["Thomas P.

Here the focus is on the development of measure and integration theory, differentiation and integration, Hilbert spaces, and Hausdorff measure and fractals. This book reflects the objective of the series as a whole: to make plain the organic unity that exists between the various parts of the subject, and to illustrate the wide applicability of ideas of analysis to other fields of mathematics and science. After setting forth the basic facts of measure theory, Lebesgue integration, and differentiation on Euclidian spaces, the authors move to the elements of Hilbert space, via the L2 theory. They next present basic illustrations of these concepts from Fourier analysis, partial differential equations, and complex analysis. The final part of the book introduces the reader to the fascinating subject of fractional-dimensional sets, including Hausdorff measure, self-replicating sets, space-filling curves, and Besicovitch sets. Each chapter has a series of exercises, from the relatively easy to the more complex, that are tied directly to the text. A substantial number of hints encourage the reader to take on even the more challenging exercises. As with the other volumes in the series, Real Analysis is accessible to students interested in such diverse disciplines as mathematics, physics, engineering, and finance, at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.

The text is a guide to the fundamental principles of medical imaging physics, radiation protection and radiation biology, with complex topics presented in the clear and concise manner and style for which these authors are known. Coverage includes the production, characteristics and interactions of ionizing radiation used in medical imaging and the imaging modalities in which they are used, including radiography, mammography, fluoroscopy, computed tomography and nuclear medicine. Special attention is paid to optimizing patient dose in each of these modalities. Sections of the book address topics common to all forms of diagnostic imaging, including image quality and medical informatics as well as the non-ionizing medical imaging modalities of MRI and ultrasound. The basic science important to nuclear imaging, including the nature and production of radioactivity, internal dosimetry and radiation detection and measurement, are presented clearly and concisely. Current concepts in the fields of radiation biology and radiation protection relevant to medical imaging, and a number of helpful appendices complete this comprehensive textbook.

Aristotle wrote: \"There is nothing in the intellect that was not first in the senses.\" He wrote that everything that is learned in life is learned through sensory perception. Aristotle was the first to establish the founding principle of logic. The great writer Dante called Aristotle \"the Master of those who know.\" The Roman writer Cicero viewed Aristotle's work so highly that he called them \"A river of gold.\" \"Again does it follow that being if one is motionless? Why should it not move, the whole of it, within itself as parts of it do which are unities; e.g., this water.\" Please Note: This book is easy to read in true text, not scanned images that can sometimes be difficult to decipher.

This was the first calculus text to use computer-generated graphics, to include exercises involving the use of computers and graphing calculators, to be available in an interactive CD-ROM format, to be offered as a complete, online calculus course, and to offer a two-semester Calculus I with Precalculus text. Every edition of the series has made the mastery of traditional calculus skills a priority, while embracing the best features of new technology and, when appropriate, calculus reform ideas. Now, the Eighth Edition is the first calculus program to offer algorithmic homework and testing created in Maple so that answers can be evaluated with complete mathematical accuracy. Two primary objectives guided the authors in writing this book: to develop precise, readable materials for students that clearly define and demonstrate concepts and rules of calculus and to design comprehensive teaching resources for instructors that employ proven pedagogical techniques and saves the instructor time. The Eighth Edition continues to provide an evolving range of conceptual, technological, and creative tools that enable instructors to teach the way they want to teach and students to learn they way they learn best.

The author has taken unusual care to motivate concepts and to simplify proofs. For example, the book presents - without having defined determinants - a clean proof that every linear operator on a finite-dimensional complex vector space has an eigenvalue. The book starts by discussing vector spaces, linear independence, span, basics, and dimension. Students are introduced to inner-product spaces in the first half of the book and shortly thereafter to the finite- dimensional spectral theorem. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra. This second edition features new chapters on diagonal matrices, on linear functionals and adjoints, and on the spectral theorem; some sections, such as those on self-adjoint and normal operators, have been entirely rewritten; and hundreds of minor improvements have been made throughout the text.","pageCount":251,"printType":"BOOK","averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":12,"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ovIYVIlithQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Linear+Algebra&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ovIYVIlithQC&dq=Linear+Algebra&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Linear_Algebra_Done_Right.html?hl=&id=ovIYVIlithQC","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ovIYVIlithQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ovIYVIlithQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"categories":["Mathematics"],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0387982590","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f88aad30a7d19d568f0a" }},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780387982595","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f88aad30a7d19d568f09" }}],"authors":["Sheldon Axler"]},"__v":0}

Now that it is dressed up as a Springer UTM volume, I feel very much like Alfred Dolittle at Eliza's wedding. I hope the reader will still sense the presence of a young lecturer, enthusiastically urging his audience to enjoy linear algebra. The book is structured in various ways. For example, you will find a test in each chapter; you may consider the material up to the test as basic and the material following the test as supplemental. In principle, it should be possible to go from the test directly to the basic material of the next chapter. Since I had a mixed audience of mathematics and physics students, I tried to give each group some special attention, which in the book results in certain sections being marked· \"for physicists\" or \"for mathematicians. \" Another structural feature of the text is its division into laconic main text, put in boxes, and more talkative unboxed side text. If you follow just the main text, jumping from box to box, you will find that it makes coherent reading, a real \"book within the book,\" presenting all that I want to teach.","pageCount":204,"printType":"BOOK","language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mAv_dofqXpYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Linear+Algebra&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mAv_dofqXpYC&dq=Linear+Algebra&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Linear_Algebra.html?hl=&id=mAv_dofqXpYC","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mAv_dofqXpYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mAv_dofqXpYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"categories":["Mathematics"],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0387941282","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f88aad30a7d19d568f1e" }},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780387941288","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f88aad30a7d19d568f1d" }}],"authors":["Klaus Jänich"]},"__v":0}

Convicted of killing thirteen people with a single curse, he was said to be the heir apparent to the Dark Lord, Voldemort, and might even have assisted in the deaths of James and Lily Potter—Harry Potter’s parents. Now Black has escaped, leaving only two clues as to where he might be headed: Harry Potter's defeat of You-Know-Who was Black's downfall as well. And the Azkaban guards heard him muttering in his sleep, \"He’s at Hogwarts... he’s at Hogwarts.\" Of course, Harry already had plenty to worry about. After inflating his nasty aunt and running away on the magical Knight Bus, he finds he’s being pursued by death omens at every turn. He receives two wonderful gifts: a top-of-the-line Firebolt broomstick, and the Marauder’s Map, a magical diagram of Hogwarts made by the mysterious “Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.” Hermione disappears frequently, burdened down by a seemingly impossible course schedule. And the soulless Dementors have come to guard Hogwarts—supposedly to protect Harry from Sirius Black, but they terrify Harry more than the fugitive ever could. To strengthen himself against them, Harry reaches out to Remus Lupin, the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who was once a friend of his father’s. Lupin teaches Harry about the Patronus Charm, a defensive measure well above the level of magic generally mastered by wizards Harry’s age. But even with his broom, his map, his magic, and his loyal friends, Harry isn't safe. Because on top of everything else, there’s a traitor hidden at Hogwarts...","printType":"BOOK","averageRating":4.5,"ratingsCount":190,"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Sm5AKLXKxHgC&dq=Harry+Potter&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Sm5AKLXKxHgC&dq=Harry+Potter&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban.html?hl=&id=Sm5AKLXKxHgC","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Sm5AKLXKxHgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Sm5AKLXKxHgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"categories":["Juvenile Fiction"],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781781100295","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f8a9ad30a7d19d568f45" }},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1781100292","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f8a9ad30a7d19d568f44" }}],"authors":["J.K.

One day just before his eleventh birthday, an owl tries to deliver a mysterious letter—the first of a sequence of events that end in Harry meeting a giant man named Hagrid. Hagrid explains Harry's history to him: When he was a baby, the Dark wizard, Lord Voldemort, attacked and killed his parents in an attempt to kill Harry; but the only mark on Harry was a mysterious lightning-bolt scar on his forehead. Now he has been invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where the headmaster is the great wizard Albus Dumbledore. Harry visits Diagon Alley to get his school supplies, especially his very own wand. To get to school, he takes the Hogwarts Express from platform nine and three-quarters at King's Cross Station. On the train, he meets two fellow students who will become his closest friends: Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Harry is assigned to Gryffindor House at Hogwarts, and soon becomes the youngest-ever Seeker on the House Quidditch team. He also studies Potions with Professor Severus Snape, who displays a deep and abiding dislike for Harry, and Defense Against the Dark Arts with nervous Professor Quirrell; he and his friends defeat a mountain troll, help Hagrid raise a dragon, and explore the wonderful, fascinating world of Hogwarts. But all events lead irrevocably toward a second encounter with Lord Voldemort, who seeks an object of legend known as the Sorcerer's Stone...","printType":"BOOK","averageRating":4.5,"ratingsCount":434,"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wrOQLV6xB-wC&dq=Harry+Potter&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wrOQLV6xB-wC&dq=Harry+Potter&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Harry_Potter_and_the_Sorcerer_s_Stone.html?hl=&id=wrOQLV6xB-wC","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wrOQLV6xB-wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wrOQLV6xB-wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"categories":["Juvenile Fiction"],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781781100271","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f8a9ad30a7d19d568f4c" }},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1781100276","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f8a9ad30a7d19d568f4b" }}],"authors":["J.K.

He wants to get away from the malicious Dursleys and go to the Quidditch World Cup with Hermione, Ron, and the Weasleys. He wants to dream about his crush, Cho Chang (and maybe do more than dream }. And now that he’s gotten the hang of things at Hogwarts—he hopes—he just wants to be a normal fourteen-year-old wizard. But even by his standards, Harry's year is anything but normal. First Dumbledore announces the revival of a grand competition that hasn't taken place for one hundred years: the Triwizard Tournament, where a Hogwarts champion will compete against rivals from two other schools of magic in three highly dangerous tasks. Then someone frames Harry to participate in the tournament—which really means someone wants him dead. Harry is guided through the competition by Professor Alastor Moody, this year's Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, but he must also contend with a nasty reporter named Rita Skeeter, who digs up some highly unflattering secrets about Hagrid; a terrible fight with Ron, who is deeply jealous of Harry's fame; Hermione's newfound activism on behalf of house-elves; and the terrifying prospect of asking a date to the Yule Ball. Worst of all, Lord Voldemort may finally have gathered the materials necessary for his rejuvenation... and he has a faithful servant at Hogwarts waiting only for a sign. No, nothing is ever normal for Harry Potter. And in his case, different can be deadly.","printType":"BOOK","averageRating":4.5,"ratingsCount":769,"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=etukl7GfrxQC&dq=Harry+Potter&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=etukl7GfrxQC&dq=Harry+Potter&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire.html?hl=&id=etukl7GfrxQC","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=etukl7GfrxQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=etukl7GfrxQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"categories":["Juvenile Fiction"],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781781100301","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f8a9ad30a7d19d568f4f" }},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1781100306","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f8a9ad30a7d19d568f4e" }}],"authors":["J.K.

Harry and Ron miss the Hogwarts Express, so they fly to school in a blue Ford Anglia, crash landing in the notorious Whomping Willow. Soon other worries accumulate: the outrageously stuck-up new professor Gilderoy Lockhart; a ghost named Moaning Myrtle, who haunts the girls' bathroom; the strange behavior of Ron's little sister, Ginny Weasley; rumors about the \"Chamber of Secrets,\" a cavern buried deep below Hogwarts; and a magical diary owned by Tom Riddle, a Hogwarts student of long ago. Harry is also shocked to discover that he can speak Parseltongue, the language of snakes - a rare ability that Lord Voldemort also possessed - and that anti-Muggle prejudice exists in the Wizarding world, even affecting Harry's friend Hermione. But all of these seem like minor concerns when someone starts turning Hogwarts students to stone: an evildoer said to be the fearsome Heir of Salazar Slytherin, on of the founders of the school. Could it be Draco Malfoy, Harry's most poisonous rival? Could it be Hagrid whose mysterious past is finally told?

She directs her book at a wide audience, including students, programmers, system designers, and researchers. Distributed Algorithms contains the most significant algorithms and impossibility results in the area, all in a simple automata-theoretic setting. The algorithms are proved correct, and their complexity is analyzed according to precisely defined complexity measures. The problems covered include resource allocation, communication, consensus among distributed processes, data consistency, deadlock detection, leader election, global snapshots, and many others. The material is organized according to the system model—first by the timing model and then by the interprocess communication mechanism. The material on system models is isolated in separate chapters for easy reference. The presentation is completely rigorous, yet is intuitive enough for immediate comprehension. This book familiarizes readers with important problems, algorithms, and impossibility results in the area: readers can then recognize the problems when they arise in practice, apply the algorithms to solve them, and use the impossibility results to determine whether problems are unsolvable. The book also provides readers with the basic mathematical tools for designing new algorithms and proving new impossibility results. In addition, it teaches readers how to reason carefully about distributed algorithms—to model them formally, devise precise specifications for their required behavior, prove their correctness, and evaluate their performance with realistic measures.","pageCount":904,"printType":"BOOK","averageRating":3,"ratingsCount":4,"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2wsrLg-xBGgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=algorithms&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2wsrLg-xBGgC&dq=algorithms&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Distributed_Algorithms.html?hl=&id=2wsrLg-xBGgC","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2wsrLg-xBGgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2wsrLg-xBGgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"categories":["Computers"],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0080504701","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f932ad30a7d19d568f77" }},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780080504704","_id":{ "$oid": "54a8f932ad30a7d19d568f76" }}],"authors":["Nancy A.

While tracing ideas from ancient Babylon to sixteenth-century Europe, the book places its greatest emphasis on the Greek period, when astronomers developed the geometric and philosophical ideas that have determined the subsequent character of Western astronomy. The author approaches this history through the concrete details of ancient astronomical practice. Carefully organized and generously illustrated, the book can teach readers how to do real astronomy using the methods of ancient astronomers. For example, readers will learn to predict the next retrograde motion of Jupiter using either the arithmetical methods of the Babylonians or the geometric methods of Ptolemy. They will learn how to use an astrolabe and how to design sundials using Greek and Roman techniques. The book also contains supplementary exercises and patterns for making some working astronomical instruments, including an astrolabe and an equatorium. More than a presentation of astronomical methods, the book provides a critical look at the evidence used to reconstruct ancient astronomy. It includes extensive excerpts from ancient texts, meticulous documentation, and lively discussions of the role of astronomy in the various cultures. Accessible to a wide audience, this book will appeal to anyone interested in how our understanding of our place in the universe has changed and developed, from ancient times through the Renaissance.","pageCount":496,"printType":"BOOK","averageRating":5,"ratingsCount":2,"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LVp_gkwyvC8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=astronomy&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LVp_gkwyvC8C&dq=astronomy&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.com/books/about/The_History_and_Practice_of_Ancient_Astr.html?hl=&id=LVp_gkwyvC8C","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LVp_gkwyvC8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LVp_gkwyvC8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"categories":["History"],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780199874453","_id":{ "$oid": "54a9d55fad30a7d19d568f91" }},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"019987445X","_id":{ "$oid": "54a9d55fad30a7d19d568f90" }}],"authors":["James Evans"]},"__v":0}
